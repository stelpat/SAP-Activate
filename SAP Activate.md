**SAP Activate Roadmap:** The "System Conversion to SAP S/4HANA" roadmap in SAP Roadmap Viewer guides brownfield projects.

**Key Considerations:**

  * **Technical Focus:**  Brownfield conversions are heavily technical, focusing on system upgrade and data migration.
  * **Limited Business Process Re-engineering:**  Less emphasis on business process re-engineering compared to greenfield.
  * **Retrofitting Customizations:**  Existing customizations need to be reviewed and retrofitted to be compatible with SAP S/4HANA.
  * **Testing Complexity:**  Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the converted system functions correctly and existing functionalities are preserved.
  * **SAP Readiness Check:**  A critical tool used in system conversions to assess system readiness and identify potential issues before the conversion process.

### 3\. Selective Data Transition (Bluefield)

**Scenario:** Selective Data Transition, often called a bluefield approach, is a **hybrid approach** that combines elements of both greenfield and brownfield. It's chosen when customers want to:

  * **Migrate to SAP S/4HANA** while selectively adopting new functionalities and business processes.
  * **Consolidate or harmonize** their system landscape during the migration.
  * **Migrate specific business entities or data** to SAP S/4HANA, rather than the entire system.

**Approach:**  Bluefield implementations allow for a more **flexible and phased migration**.  Customers can choose which business processes and data to migrate to SAP S/4HANA, potentially leaving some parts of their legacy system landscape untouched initially.

**SAP Activate Roadmap:**  The "Selective Data Transition to SAP S/4HANA" roadmap in SAP Roadmap Viewer guides bluefield projects.

**Key Considerations:**

  * **Hybrid Approach:**  Combines elements of both greenfield and brownfield, offering flexibility.
  * **Complex Scope Definition:**  Requires careful planning and scope definition to determine which processes and data to migrate.
  * **System Integration:**  Integration between the new SAP S/4HANA system and any remaining legacy systems is crucial.
  * **Data Migration Complexity:**  Selective data migration can be complex, requiring careful data mapping and transformation.

### 4\. Hybrid Scenarios and Two-Tier ERP

SAP Activate also supports **hybrid deployment scenarios**, where customers may have a mix of cloud and on-premise SAP solutions.  **Two-tier ERP** is a common hybrid scenario where a large enterprise implements SAP S/4HANA (typically cloud) for subsidiaries or specific business units, while retaining a different ERP system (often SAP ECC or S/4HANA on-premise) at the corporate level.

**SAP Activate in Hybrid Scenarios:**

  * Provides guidance for integrating cloud and on-premise SAP solutions.
  * Offers roadmaps and best practices for two-tier ERP implementations.
  * Addresses integration challenges and data synchronization in hybrid landscapes.

## Agile Project Planning and Delivery in SAP Activate

SAP Activate is fundamentally an **agile methodology**, emphasizing iterative development, flexibility, and customer collaboration. Agile principles are woven into the fabric of SAP Activate, particularly in the **Realize phase**, where the solution is built and tested.

### Agile Principles in SAP Activate

  * **Iterative Development (Sprints):** The Realize phase is structured into **iterations called sprints**. Each sprint is a short cycle (typically 2-4 weeks) focused on delivering a specific set of functionalities.
  * **Sprint Planning:** At the beginning of each sprint, the project team conducts sprint planning to:
      * **Select User Stories:**  Choose user stories from the product backlog to be implemented in the sprint.
      * **Define Sprint Goal:**  Establish a clear objective for the sprint.
      * **Task Breakdown:**  Break down user stories into smaller, manageable tasks.
      * **Sprint Backlog:**  Create a sprint backlog containing the tasks for the sprint.
  * **Daily Scrum:**  Short daily meetings for the development team to synchronize activities, identify impediments, and plan the day's work.
  * **Sprint Review:** At the end of each sprint, the team conducts a sprint review to:
      * **Demonstrate the Solution:**  Showcase the functionalities developed in the sprint to stakeholders (including the customer).
      * **Gather Feedback:**  Collect feedback from stakeholders on the delivered functionalities.
      * **Validate Solution:**  Ensure the solution aligns with requirements and expectations.
  * **Sprint Retrospective:**  After the sprint review, the team conducts a retrospective to:
      * **Reflect on the Sprint:**  Analyze what went well and what could be improved in the sprint.
      * **Identify Improvements:**  Define actions to improve processes and team performance in future sprints.
  * **Product Backlog:**  A prioritized list of features, functionalities, and requirements for the SAP solution. User stories are typically used to represent items in the product backlog.
  * **User Stories:**  Short, user-centric descriptions of a desired feature or functionality, typically in the format: "As a \[user role], I want \[goal] so that \[benefit]". User stories help to ensure that development is focused on delivering business value.
  * **Fit-to-Standard Workshops in Agile:** Fit-to-standard workshops, crucial in the Explore phase, are also integrated into the agile approach. They help to validate the fit of standard SAP functionalities within each sprint and identify delta requirements early in the development cycle.
  * **Definition of Done (DoD):**  Clear criteria that define when a user story or task is considered complete. DoD ensures consistent quality and shared understanding of completion. DoD typically includes aspects like:
      * **Functionality Developed and Tested:**  Code is written, unit tested, and meets acceptance criteria.
      * **Documentation Updated:**  Relevant documentation is updated to reflect the changes.
      * **User Enablement Considerations:**  Training or user guidance is considered.

### Agile Project Delivery

SAP Activate's agile approach to project delivery offers several advantages:

  * **Faster Value Delivery:**  Iterative sprints deliver working functionalities in short cycles, allowing customers to realize value early and continuously.
  * **Improved Flexibility and Adaptability:**  Agile sprints allow for easy adaptation to changing requirements and feedback throughout the project.
